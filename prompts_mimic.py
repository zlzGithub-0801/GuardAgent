(1) Tables are linked by identifiers which usually have the suffix 'ID'. For example, SUBJECT_ID refers to a unique patient, HADM_ID refers to a unique admission to the hospital, and ICUSTAY_ID refers to a unique admission to an intensive care unit.
(2) Charted events such as notes, laboratory tests, and fluid balance are stored in a series of 'events' tables. For example the outputevents table contains all measurements related to output for a given patient, while the labevents table contains laboratory test results for a patient.
(3) Tables prefixed with 'd_' are dictionary tables and provide definitions for identifiers. For example, every row of chartevents is associated with a single ITEMID which represents the concept measured, but it does not contain the actual name of the measurement. By joining chartevents and d_items on ITEMID, it is possible to identify the concept represented by a given ITEMID.
(4) For the databases, four of them are used to define and track patient stays: admissions, patients, icustays, and transfers. Another four tables are dictionaries for cross-referencing codes against their respective definitions: d_icd_diagnoses, d_icd_procedures, d_items, and d_labitems. The remaining tables, including chartevents, cost, inputevents_cv, labevents, microbiologyevents, outputevents, prescriptions, procedures_icd, contain data associated with patient care, such as physiological measurements, caregiver observations, and billing information.
For different tables, they contain the following information:
(1) admissions: ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, ADMITTIME, DISCHTIME, ADMISSION_TYPE, ADMISSION_LOCATION, DISCHARGE_LOCATION, INSURANCE, LANGUAGE, MARITAL_STATUS, ETHNICITY, AGE
(2) chartevents: ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, ICUSTAY_ID, ITEMID, CHARTTIME, VALUENUM, VALUEUOM
(3) cost: ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, EVENT_TYPE, EVENT_ID, CHARGETIME, COST
(4) d_icd_diagnoses: ROW_ID, ICD9_CODE, SHORT_TITLE, LONG_TITLE
(5) d_icd_procedures: ROW_ID, ICD9_CODE, SHORT_TITLE, LONG_TITLE
(6) d_items: ROW_ID, ITEMID, LABEL, LINKSTO
(7) d_labitems: ROW_ID, ITEMID, LABEL
(8) dianoses_icd: ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, ICD9_CODE, CHARTTIME
(9) icustays: ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, ICUSTAY_ID, FIRST_CAREUNIT, LAST_CAREUNIT, FIRST_WARDID, LAST_WARDID, INTIME, OUTTIME
(10) inputevents_cv: ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, ICUSTAY_ID, CHARTTIME, ITEMID, AMOUNT

Question: What is the maximum total hospital cost that involves a diagnosis named comp-oth vasc dev/graft since 1 year ago?
Knowledge: 
- As comp-oth vasc dev/graft is a diagnose, the corresponding ICD9_CODE can be found in the d_icd_diagnoses database.
- The ICD9_CODE can be used to find the corresponding HADM_ID in the diagnoses_icd database.
- The HADM_ID can be used to find the corresponding COST in the cost database.

Question: had any tpn w/lipids been given to patient 2238 in their last hospital visit?
Knowledge: 
- We can find the visiting information of patient 2238 in the admissions database.
- As tpn w/lipids is an item, we can find the corresponding information in the d_items database.
- As admissions only contains the visiting information of patients, we need to find the corresponding ICUSTAY_ID in the icustays database.
- We will check the inputevents_cv database to see if there is any record of tpn w/lipids given to patient 2238 in their last hospital visit. 

Question: what was the name of the procedure that was given two or more times to patient 58730?
Knowledge: 
- We can find the visiting information of patient 58730 in the admissions database.
- As procedures are stored in the procedures_icd database, we can find the corresponding ICD9_CODE in the procedures_icd database.
- As we only need to find the name of the procedure, we can find the corresponding SHORT_TITLE as the name in the d_icd_procedures database.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding and language skills.
In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh
coding block) for the user to execute.
1. When you need to collect info, use the code to output the info you need, for example, browse or
search the web, download/read a file, print the content of a webpage or a file, get the current
date/time. After sufficient info is printed and the task is ready to be solved based on your
language skill, you can solve the task by yourself.
2. When you need to perform some task with code, use the code to perform the task and output the
result. Finish the task smartly.
Solve the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. Be
clear which step uses code, and which step uses your language skill.
When using code, you must indicate the script type in the code block. The user cannot provide any
other feedback or perform any other action beyond executing the code you suggest. The user can't
modify your code. So do not suggest incomplete code which requires users to modify. Don't use a
code block if it's not intended to be executed by the user.
If you want the user to save the code in a file before executing it, put # filename: <filename>
inside the code block as the first line. Don't include multiple code blocks in one response. Do not
ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.
Check the execution result returned by the user.
If the result indicates there is an error, fix the error and output the code again. Suggest the
full code instead of partial code or code changes. If the error can't be fixed or if the task is
not solved even after the code is executed successfully, analyze the problem, revisit your
assumption, collect additional info you need, and think of a different approach to try.
When you find an answer, verify the answer carefully. Include verifiable evidence in your response
if possible.
